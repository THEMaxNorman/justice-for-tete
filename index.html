        <h2>The story of Portlander Titi Gulley:</h2><br>
      
      Gulley (whose name has also been spelled “TeTe”) was a homeless Black trangender woman whose body was found hanging from a tree in Rocky Butte Park on May 27, 2019. After examining Gulley’s body and interviewing two people from the homeless camp where Gulley was living, Portland Police Bureau (PPB) quickly determined Gulley’s death was a suicide.
<br>
      <br>
But Gulley’s family disagreed with PPB’s conclusion. They heard from Gulley’s friends and acquaintances that there were rumors of foul play swirling in the Portland homeless community, and that possible video evidence existed of Gulley’s death. Many of the rumors centered on the theory that Gulley was killed by a man she’d had a sexual relationship with, who killed her because he wanted to keep his relationship with a trans woman secret. (Gay men and trans women are often killed by their romantic partners for this reason, a practice that is called “gay panic” or “trans panic.”) This man is named in the police report as the person who found Gulley’s body.
<br>
      <br>
Gulley’s mother and two siblings told the Mercury last year that they felt Gulley’s identity as a trans, Black, homeless person prompted PPB to not apply a high level of scrutiny to its investigation.
<br>
      <br>
“You know they treat a lot of homeless people like they don’t mean nothing to this earth, right?” said Richard Bryant, Gulley’s brother, in an interview with the Mercury last year. “So in the homeless community, other people are willing to do hurt to more people, because they know their voices won’t be heard. They’re just homeless.”
<br>
      <br>
After the Mercury and other local news outlets reported on the family’s concerns, PPB briefly reopened its investigation. The police report associated with Gulley’s death, recently obtained through a public records request, shows that the investigation was opened for an additional 16 days (from June 12 through June 28). It involved interviews with fewer than 10 people—two people alleged to have information about Gulley’s death, and a handful of people who lived in Gulley’s homeless camp at the time of her death.
<br>
      <br>
The report shows that police officers attempted to contact a few other people who were with Gulley in the days before her death, or were believed to have additional information. But PPB officers gave up after not receiving calls back from those people.
<br>
      <br>
“No evidence indicating Gulley's death was a homicide has surfaced,” wrote PPB Detective Brendan McGuire in the report. “It appears that the spreading of unsubstantiated rumors and misinformation... are the primary causes behind those questioning the original findings.”
<br>
      <br>
The report also notes that residents of the Rocky Butte Park homeless camp said Gulley had attempted suicide in the past, before her death in May 2019.
<br>
      <br>
Kenya Robinson, Gulley’s mother, said in a recent interview with the Mercury that she didn’t feel the investigation was very rigorous, even after it was reopened. Over the last year, Robinson has continued to receive tips from people who don’t believe Gulley’s death was a suicide—and Robinson doesn’t think so, either.
<br>
      <br>
“I’ve got my fingers crossed,” Robinson said, “that the police department will listen, that the police department will get off their butts and do something… instead of thinking about somebody’s life like it doesn’t matter.”<br>
